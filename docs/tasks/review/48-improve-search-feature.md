# Task 48: Improve search feature

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2026-01-29
**Depends on**: none
**Blocks**: none

## Problem

Search forced field type selection before typing. Should search all fields by default.

## Success criteria

- [x] Search queries all fields by default
- [x] Arrow down to narrow: name, address, hashtag
- [x] "jason in al" syntax searches name + address

## Done

Search is now immediate, all-fields by default. Optional narrowing via arrow-down selector. Added "X in Y" syntax for name-in-address searches.
